# Zoom Meeting Notes

## 11/19/2021

- Topic finalized with Andee a few days prior, looking at an Olympic dataset and trying to predict future medalings
all related to the Russian Doping scandel in the 2012 London games.
- For thanksgiving break everybody needs to look at the data and clean it up a bit. Find some questions and see to it 
to try some modeling
- Meet again somepoint towards the end of thanksgiving break.

## 11/28/2021

- Reconvenied after thanksgiving. 
- Evan and Jake discussed the project, both found issues with the overall size of our data. Any model we tried to fit 
held restirctions to a size of 2.4 GB when our data was almost double that. Looked at graphs depicting medal standings 
related to height and weight.
- After looking at the athletes that were penalized for doping we found a.) most of it was winter sports (bobsledding, 
skeleton, cross-country skiinng, hockey, luge, etc..) and b.) the russian team got a gold medal in 4 person bobsledding
as well as a gold medal in 2 person bobsledding. Every member of these two teams ended up being categorized as postiive
for doping 6 other russian bobsledders who did not place. We came to the decision to transition to one singular sport and 
try and classify the most recent years (2004-2012) of olympic athletes to predict the next two olympic games. 
- Weight is in kilos so we converted to pounds.

- Goals for next meeting:
  Evan: Build a tree based model on the data
  Jake: Build a QDA classification 
  Ali: Build a tree based model and QDA classification
- During next meeting reconvene with what we found and compare.

## 12/2/2021
- Jake and Evan shared fitted models of tree and qda methods
- Bagged trees and rf saw the most success, especially with binary response (medal, did not medal)
- Most problems with other methods centered around not outputting predicted athletes as medal winners (hardly ever)
- Looked at potential other sports, all have same problems with no correlation between any predictor variables. Best prospect was cross country skiing
Goals:
Evan: Look further into tree based methods
Jake: attempt to get knn and qda to work
Ali: fit knn model and get an idea on error rates

## 12/5/2021
- Jake, Evan, and Ali met to discuss their findings on trees and KNN from the goals of last meeting.
- KNN seemed to work the best in terms of error rate for our model predictions, still not amazing prediction results but the best so far.
- Split our data into just using predicting on a few years of data to predict the 2014 winter olympic bobsleigh teams. 
- Started discussing how we would produce the presentation
Goals:
Talk to Andee about potential options to limit the number of predictions as our predictions were yielding more medals than could have been given out.
