# project-8
Class project for group 8 in DSCI445 @ CSU

We are looking at Olympic Datasets in order to predict the results of the 2016 Olympic medal standings. We will be looking at the Russian doping scandal that was publicized during the 2012 and 2014 olympic games. We will take the 43 (https://olympics.nbcsports.com/2017/11/27/sochi-olympic-medal-standings-russia-medals-stripped-doping/) Russian athletes that were disqualified and see if predictions for 2016 would change if they were never caught and were able to participate in the 2016 olympics.
