# project-8
Class project for group 8 in DSCI445 @ CSU

Our project is looking at Olympic Datasets in order to predict the results of the 2014 Olympic medal standings. We will be looking at the Russian doping scandal that was publicized during the 2012 and 2014 olympic games. We will take the 43 (https://olympics.nbcsports.com/2017/11/27/sochi-olympic-medal-standings-russia-medals-stripped-doping/) Russian athletes that were disqualified and see if we can predict who would have actually one based on data from the prior 3 olympic games.

In our github we have four folders, the first being Paper which holds our rmd file for our paper and the dataset we used in said paper. All that is needed is the data.csv dataset and the paper in order to run it all. The second folder is our presentation folder, in order to run this you would need the presentation folder and all of the files in the data folder. We called the csv files from the data folder and also some of the individual r files. The final folder is titled code, this is just a few extra documents with code that do not contribute to either the paper or presenetation. All these are are files to show some  of the work we did prior to writing the paper and presentation, you do not need to look at these for anything other than contribution history.
