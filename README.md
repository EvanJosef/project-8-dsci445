# project-8
Class project for group 8 in DSCI445 @ CSU

Our project is looking at Olympic Datasets in order to predict the results of the 2014 Olympic medal standings. We will be looking at the Russian doping scandal that was publicized during the 2012 and 2014 olympic games. We will take the 43 (https://olympics.nbcsports.com/2017/11/27/sochi-olympic-medal-standings-russia-medals-stripped-doping/) Russian athletes that were disqualified and see if we can predict who would have actually one based on data from the prior 3 olympic games.
